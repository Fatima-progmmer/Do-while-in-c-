# Do-While Loop in C

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation and explanation of the **do-while loop** in the C programming language. The `do-while` loop is a type of loop that executes at least once before checking the condition.

## Key Features
- Demonstrates the syntax and working of the `do-while` loop.
- Provides example programs for better understanding.
- Helps beginners grasp the concept through practical implementation.

## Syntax
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    do {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
1. The loop executes the block of code inside `do { ... }` at least once.
2. After execution, it checks the condition inside `while(condition);`.
3. If the condition is true, the loop runs again; otherwise, it stops.

## Example Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fatima-progmmer/Do-while-in-c-
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Do-while-in-c-
   ```
3. Compile the program using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc do_while_example.c -o do_while_example
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./do_while_example
   ```
